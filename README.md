A safe and ergonomic `#![no_std]` crate to bind the NVIDIA¬Æ Tools Extension SDK (NVTX) with zero-cost abstraction.

NVIDIA¬Æ Tools Extension SDK (NVTX) is a C-based Application Programming Interface (API) for annotating events, code ranges, and resources in your applications.
Official documentation for NVIDIA¬Æ's NVTX can be found [here](https://nvidia.github.io/NVTX/doxygen/index.html).

This library is a wrapper over that SDK, safely, and with zero-cost abstractions. This library facilitates integration into the rich CPU and GPU profiling tools provided by NVIDIA¬Æ, such as NSight Systems. The primary motivation for this library is to assist research GPU analysts and bring NVIDIA¬Æ tools to Rust. This crate is `#![no_std]`.

# ‚û°Ô∏è Quickstart

The crate is published on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nvtx) and the easiest way to use nvtx is by adding the dependency to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
nvtx = "1.1.1"
```

![Example](assets/screenshot.png)

There are several examples in the [`examples`](examples) folder which can be executed through tools such as NSight Systems. Each example has a README document with easy to read steps, screenshots, and documentation. Check out the first example, '[Hello, World!](https://github.com/simbleau/nvtx/tree/main/examples/hello_world)'
